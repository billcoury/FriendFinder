The app uses Express to serve 2 HTML files and 2 API routes to get and post data.

Note that data is not persistent, but rather stored in an object in friends.js for your current session.

# Instructions
After cloning the repo, run npm install to download the Node dependencies. Launch the app in localhost:8080 in your browser.
